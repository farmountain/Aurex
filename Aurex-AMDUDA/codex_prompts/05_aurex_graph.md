# Module Prompt: amduda_core/aurex_graph.rs

**Task:**
Design a graph execution engine to schedule computation nodes.

**Requirements:**
1. Core:
   - `Node` struct representing an operation.
   - `Graph` struct storing nodes and edges.
   - Simple scheduler that executes nodes in order.
2. Optional:
   - Feature-gated execution paths for specialized backends.
3. Unit Test:
   - Build a graph with two nodes and verify both execute.
