# Aurex-AMDUDA

A CUDA-alternative, AI-native compute runtime targeting AMD/Intel GPUs and CPU SIMD. The project focuses on a modular core runtime that can operate independently with optional integrations.

## Mission
- Support tensor operations across Vulkan, ROCm, OpenCL, and CPU backends.
- Provide a procedural kernel scheduler with JIT capabilities.
- Manage multi-tier memory from GPU shared memory to NVMe paging.
- Deliver a standalone LLM inference engine for 7Bâ€“70B models with quantization.

Optional integrations include HipCortex symbolic memory, AUREUS agent runtime, and Quantum Seed Engine for regenerative inference.
